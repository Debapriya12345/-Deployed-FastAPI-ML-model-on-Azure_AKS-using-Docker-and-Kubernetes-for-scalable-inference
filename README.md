# ðŸš€-Deployed-FastAPI-ML-model-on-Azure_AKS-using-Docker-and-Kubernetes-for-scalable-inference

ðŸ“Œ Deployed a FastAPI-based ML classification model to production using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable inference. Containerized
 the app with Docker and exposed it via Kubernetes services and ingress. Focused on model deployment, API development, and cloud-native
infrastructure aligned with MLOps best practices.

ðŸ§ Tech Stack Used 

âœ… FastApi : To Build Rest Api to perform CRUD operations, data processing, or integration with other services using Python 

âœ… Docker files : To create images for deployment purpose

âœ… ingress and service yaml files : To Deploy in Azure K8S service(AKS) and expose the model from outside and balance the load internally.

âœ… Random Forest : Build Bagging based ML mode (Random Forest) for Classification purpose
